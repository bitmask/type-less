Step 1: Combine the rows of A1 and A2 into a file called A
        These are expression levels for genes of a pulldown experiment.

Step 2: File B contains the common names of the genes in A, and they are sorted in the same order as A.
        Combine the columns of A and B into a file called AB.

Step 3: File C also contains the common names of the genes, but it has lines for all the yeast genes.
        Combine the columns of A and C into a file called AC.

        Hint: you might need to sort A and C first

Step 4: (Bonus) Check that files AB and AC are exactly the same.  If they are not the same, why not?
